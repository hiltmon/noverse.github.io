Real users found it confusing, so I wrote my own.
What&rsquo;s wrong with the Apple implementation? The requirement is for the user to pick a phone number for a contact.
The implementation requires you to launch an address book picker which displays a list of contact names - just the names and nothing else.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/03/11/replacing-the-address-book-picker/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 3, 2010 10:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/03/03/how-to-deal-with-an-iphone-crash-report/>How to deal with an iPhone crash report</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Kudos to the app review team at Apple, they found a crasher in the update to Emergency List that I recently submitted.

1. Launch app connected to a network 2. Tap Emergency List 3. Tap the Add button 4. Tap Add from Address Book 5.

Backup I run a SCCS server on a separate computer, not my development box, so that all my brilliant code is stored safely on a second computer. If anything happens to my primary development box, no dramas, I can get the code back from the server.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/02/01/use-source-code-control-even-when-working-on-your-own/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 29, 2010 3:38 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/01/29/what-is-a-software-designer/>What is a Software Designer?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I call myself a Software Designer. So should you. Here&rsquo;s why.
If we ignore the dictionary and follow colloquial use, we could be called a:
Programmer - someone who writes software code. Unfortunately, it is implied that programmers do not design the software, nor do they decide what to do next or how things will work, they merely translate a limited set of requirements or a small part of the design into code.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/01/29/what-is-a-software-designer/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 25, 2010 3:21 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/01/25/first-draft-application-design-emergency-list/>First Draft Application Design - Emergency List</a></h1><p class=summary-body>We know what I want to develop, see The First Application - Emergency List. As its an iPhone app, the first step is to draw up the user interface. In this post we&rsquo;ll look at a mockup of the interface and some of the thinking behind it.
The Interface - Favorites The first requirement is that it should take only two taps to call an emergency number, tap once to launch the app, tap again to call the emergency number.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/01/25/first-draft-application-design-emergency-list/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 20, 2010 12:40 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/01/20/the-first-application-emergency-list/>The First Application - Emergency List</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Most people I know, especially the elderly and those with kids, have a piece of paper taped to their landline phones containing a list of emergency or key contact numbers. That way, when needed, the number needed is easily found, and anyone can dial it.
I intend to create an iPhone application to do this.
Problems it will Solve Calling the right number in an emergency very very quickly without having to search for it Finding the necessary supporting information when making an emergency call Sharing the list and keeping it up to date Key Features and Benefits Feature 1: Two taps to call the top emergency contacts - I&rsquo;d like the top 5 emergency numbers to be presented on startup, allowing the user to tap to launch the app, then tap an entry to dial.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/01/20/the-first-application-emergency-list/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://noverse.com/page/6/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://noverse.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://noverse.com/page/4/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><section><h1>About Noverse LLC</h1><p>Noverse is a New York independent software designer and developer, established in 2010 by Hilton Lipschitz (<a href=https://hiltmon.com>@hiltmon</a>) to provide <em>experienced</em> consulting and development services for Hedge Funds, and to craft brilliant web, iOS and Macintosh software.</p><p><strong>For more recent writing, go to Hilton's public web site at <a href=https://hiltmon.com>hiltmon.com</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=https://noverse.com/contact>Contact</a> |
