Choosing the right price is even harder.
For Sights to See, I will release it at $9.99.
Let the wailing begin!
Customer value proposition From a customer&rsquo;s perspective the value proposition is easy to figure out.
If the customer buys a paper guide book, it costs about $20.00 from Amazon. The paper guide book is limited to only the places in it, weighs a lot, is hard to navigate and to navigate with, and is usually out of date.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/08/11/the-price-of-sights-to-see/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 10, 2010 11:14 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/08/10/how-to-deal-with-an-iphone-crash-report-a-better-way/>How to deal with an iPhone crash report, a better way</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There is an easier way to deal with an iPhone crash report than in my previous article How to deal with an iPhone crash report. And here it is.
Before you release the app Run a Build and Archive in Xcode, making sure that the version you are building is the one you are sending out (beta release or final release, properly code signed).
Xcode builds the app, the places the app, its dSYM file, a plist and the ipa file in ~/Library/Mobiledevice/Archived Applications/&lt;UUID>/ where it can be found and managed by Organizer and by spotlight.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/08/10/how-to-deal-with-an-iphone-crash-report-a-better-way/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 31, 2010 5:01 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/07/31/hanging-out-my-shingle/>Hanging out my shingle</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have freed up enough of my time to be able to offer my skills as technology strategist, systems architect, software designer, consultant, public speaker, programmer and super software sage for hire.
I have 21 years of experience, started out as a programmer, grew into a complex project manager, and landed up as Chief Technology Officer (and number one programming guru) at two successful and very complex hedge funds. 21 years of experience makes me a great programmer, accomplished systems architect and seasoned manager.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/07/31/hanging-out-my-shingle/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 31, 2010 1:24 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/07/31/beta-testing-is-hard-but-oh-so-worth-it/>Beta testing is hard, but oh so worth it</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So you&rsquo;ve built the next killer app, and it looks and feels and works exactly how you dreamed, designed, planned and sweated to make it. Even the non-programming stuff is as brilliant as you can make it, the web site, the artwork, the documentation and the press goodies. As far as you are concerned, it&rsquo;s ready to ship - and real developers ship after all.
Not so fast, bucakaroo! Best to beta test first.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/07/31/beta-testing-is-hard-but-oh-so-worth-it/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 16, 2010 10:50 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/07/16/testing-the-new-web-design/>Testing the new Web Design</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I decided to revamp the noverse.com website before it became too complex. The original site had too many pages, and tons of html was being repeated. Every change had to be made in too many places, and as a developer, that violates the rules.
So, I switched from HTML/CSS to PHP-HTML/CSS. Easy. The only PHP I am using is to include common blocks of code, like the navigation bar, sidebar and footer.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/07/16/testing-the-new-web-design/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 24, 2010 12:17 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/05/24/one-two-four-eight-the-indie-developers-life/>One Two Four Eight - The Indie Developer's Life</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Instructions: For timespan, insert day, week, month, year, eon or parsec.

Build Version 1.0 Core features only, focus on the primary need
One timespan to write the core feature and prove the application.
Two timespans to add the minimum and absolutely necessary features to give the application Version 1.0 functionality and no more.
Four timespans to get it stable, fast and mostly bug free.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/05/24/one-two-four-eight-the-indie-developers-life/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 15, 2010 11:57 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/05/15/app-sales-free-vs-99c/>App Sales, free vs 99c</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I ran a test while on vacation. For the 3.5 weeks I was away, I changed the price of Emergency List from free to 99c to see how this would affect sales.
It did.
A lot.
Before the price change, I had daily sales in the tens of units.
After the price change, I had three sales in 3.5 weeks. Zero sales every other day.
So I set the price back to zero two days ago, just to see what would happen.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/05/15/app-sales-free-vs-99c/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 15, 2010 11:37 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/05/15/ipad-update-after-almost-a-month-traveling-with-it/>iPad Update - after almost a month traveling with it</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have now had the iPad for five weeks, three and a half of which were spent traveling through Eastern Europe with it as my only companion device (other than the iPhone 3GS). Short version, it&rsquo;s brilliant. Long version, still brilliant.
On the trip:
The wifi issues that plagued me at home were never seen. When there was wifi available, that is. Most hotels had some kind of wifi available, but they charged an arm and a leg for it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/05/15/ipad-update-after-almost-a-month-traveling-with-it/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 12, 2010 10:56 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/04/12/its-been-one-week-since-you-looked-at-me/>It's been one week since you looked at me</a></h1><p class=summary-body>After a week with the iPad&mldr;
I have read a few books on it. In fact, that&rsquo;s where I have spent most of my time on it. The text is easy to read about three notches from smallest, but I need to dim the screen at night as it gets too bright. No eyestrain so far. I have made a few of my own documents into ePubs and it works great.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/04/12/its-been-one-week-since-you-looked-at-me/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 4, 2010 12:32 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/04/04/ipad-first-impressions/>iPad First Impressions</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I&rsquo;ve had an iPad now for 24 hours and these are my initial impressions of the device and its software.
Hardware It&rsquo;s heavier than I expected, but feels nice and solid. I do seem to get tired holding it, but I guess my hands and arms will get used to it. The plasticky power switch, orientation lock and home button click sound and feel cheap. The screen is awesome. Bright, colorful, wide viewing angle and totally smudged by my fingerprints.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/04/04/ipad-first-impressions/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://noverse.com/page/5/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://noverse.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://noverse.com/page/3/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><section><h1>About Noverse LLC</h1><p>Noverse is a New York independent software designer and developer, established in 2010 by Hilton Lipschitz (<a href=https://hiltmon.com>@hiltmon</a>) to provide <em>experienced</em> consulting and development services for Hedge Funds, and to craft brilliant web, iOS and Macintosh software.</p><p><strong>For more recent writing, go to Hilton's public web site at <a href=https://hiltmon.com>hiltmon.com</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=https://noverse.com/contact>Contact</a> |
