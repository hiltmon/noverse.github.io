Whenever a new report is needed, new analysis, new form, data conversion, no matter the task, they turn to Excel. They make everything look like a nail, and the only tool they understand is Excel, so they use it like a hammer. The result? Manual processes, inconsistent data, key-person dependencies, inflexibility, pain and suffering.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/03/05/to-a-nail-everything-looks-like-a-hammer/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 21, 2011 4:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/01/21/delivering-solutions-corporate-appliance-or-hosted/>Delivering Solutions: Corporate, Appliance or Hosted</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have just spent the past few weeks working on the initial design of a new product for Noverse.

But what does this mythical person do? Are they a graphics designer? An architect? A consultant?
A software designer is an individual who has the vision, passion, communication, understanding, flexibility and process to generate software form; and make the necessary decisions about what, when, where and how in development.
Note that the designer does not necessarily conceptualize the idea.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/12/16/it-takes-a-software-designer/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 11, 2010 11:32 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/12/11/a-few-good-men/>A Few Good Men</a></h1><p class=summary-body>With apologies to the movie A Few Good Men, 1992, directed by Rob Reiner.
The right team size for software development. How many people does it take to develop a Software Product? How big a team will I need to create to tools for my business? I need to migrate this legacy software to a new platform, how many programmers will I need?
These are common questions asked of CTO&rsquo;s, IT Consultants, startups, techies and, of course, me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/12/11/a-few-good-men/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 1, 2010 1:59 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/12/01/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-iphone-application/>How much does it cost to develop an iPhone application?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>This question was asked, and answered, on stackoverflow.com 2 years ago, and has been viewed almost 200,000 times. I was one of the people who answered the question (click here).
There are three components in almost every iPhone app: a server component, a design component and an app component.
Server Component The server component of an iPhone app usually takes the most effort and chews up the majority of the budget.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/12/01/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-iphone-application/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 28, 2010 1:38 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/10/28/waterfall-waterfail/>Waterfall Waterfail</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The waterfall model for software development has gone the way of the dodo (and did so at about the same time). Yet this newly minted indie developer often gets requests for proposals that follow this model, fixed-time, fixed-process and fixed-price.
I instantly and politely decline these requests.
I don&rsquo;t ever want to decline work, and when I set up this business, I planned to say yes to every potential client and service them as best as possible.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/10/28/waterfall-waterfail/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 15, 2010 1:42 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/10/15/sprint-coding/>Sprint Coding</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sprint Coding is the process whereby a skilled programmer busts out a quality application in record time.
Its not easy. Fast coding means faster bugs. Quick coding means rotten quality. Rapid development means architecture is ignored. Cowboy coding produces unmaintainable code. In short, I don&rsquo;t recommend it.
But, my dear padawan, it is do-able under the right circumstances. Rare circumstances. Recommend this, I do not.
Scenario, this is. A client called up at the beginning of October and asked if I could produce an iPhone app for them.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/10/15/sprint-coding/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 30, 2010 5:04 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2010/09/30/sights-to-see-ipad-version-progress-part-1/>Sights to See iPad Version Progress, Part 1</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The iPad version of Sights to See is coming along nicely.

Here are a few screenshots to whet your appetite.

The blues come from two sources, shipping and waiting.
