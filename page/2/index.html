Since programmers are human, and humans make mistakes, ergo bugs. When you come across a bug in our software, or anyone else&rsquo;s for that matter, you need to email in a bug report. The developer can use this to identify the problem, replicate the problem and fix it.
But most of the time, we developers find submitted bug reports to be incomprehensible. This is because the submitter has no idea what we need, how to communicate with us and how to write one of these bug report things.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/06/15/how-to-write-a-good-bug-report/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 24, 2012 3:25 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/03/24/almost-shipping/>Almost Shipping</a></h1><p class=summary-body>After a year of discussions, planning, designing, programming, testing and making it happen, we&rsquo;re about to ship the 1.0 version of Kifu.
But almost shipping is not the same as shipping.
The product is feature complete for version 1.0. It was a hard road getting here, and even harder to say no to features that would have delayed shipping. But it&rsquo;s done, its almost shipping.
Almost shipping are where you are when there are still hundreds of small and sometimes large details that need to be right before you truly ship a web app.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/03/24/almost-shipping/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 5, 2012 11:31 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/03/05/presenting-a-professional-indie-image/>Presenting a Professional Indie Image</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As my hiltmon.com blog takes off, I am starting to get emails from indie developers promoting their wares. This is great, I love getting them, looking at new products and helping out where I can. But many of them fail on the basics of presenting themselves as the professionals they are.
In this article, I will present a checklist of all the things you need as an indie to present yourself to strangers via email with some credibility.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/03/05/presenting-a-professional-indie-image/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 12, 2012 9:10 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/02/12/end-of-life-sights-to-see-and-emergency-list/>End of Life - Sights to See and Emergency List</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Noverse is sad to announce that we have taken down Emergency List and Sights to See from the iPhone App Store.
What? Really? Why? These apps were developed two years ago, for old versions of the iPhone, and no longer represent the best we can do. We were learning iOS at the time, did not have access to the right designers and did the best we could back then. It got us the business we did the last 2 years.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2012/02/12/end-of-life-sights-to-see-and-emergency-list/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 27, 2011 9:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/12/27/hiltmon-com/>Moving to Hiltmon.com</a></h1><p class=summary-body>You may have noticed less activity on this site. Or not. I have consolidated all my old blogs, and begun writing a more controversial and wide ranging blog at my personal domain https://hiltmon.com.

Yet most software fits this bill, it does something &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; to get the work done or even sell. Even though the user has to jump through hoops to do so, or create workarounds to make the whole thing work.
At Noverse, we don&rsquo;t make &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; software. Our products must be brilliant, they must be flexible, they must be proven correct, they must get the job done without workarounds, they must be fast and easy to use, they must be amazing.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/09/17/get-it-brilliant/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 31, 2011 3:36 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/07/31/alpha-testing/>Alpha Testing</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Everybody talks about Beta testing, unit testing and integration testing, but there is little on Alpha testing out there. At Noverse, we do them all.
What is Alpha Testing? If you follow the Wikipedia definition, Alpha testing happens when the product is incomplete and yet still handed over to a testing team inside the organization. And Beta testing happens when the customer gets to test pre-release versions.
For us, a small indie developer, we have no separate testing or Q&A team, so our Alpha testing is done with our customers as well.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/07/31/alpha-testing/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 13, 2011 5:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/05/13/keeping-customers-engaged-early/>Keeping Customers Engaged Early</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The early stages of a software development project are brilliant for a designer/developer and painful for a customer. For the developer, the challenge of design, the joy of programming the core functionality, and the absolute bliss you get from making something great keeps the developer engaged. The customer sits and waits. And waits.
Traditionally, that wait lasts a long time, all the way until Alpha builds are available. Even with agile programming techniques, there really isn&rsquo;t much to show the customer during the early stages.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/05/13/keeping-customers-engaged-early/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 5, 2011 11:48 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://noverse.com/blog/2011/04/05/time-and-material-contracts-with-a-process/>Time and Material Contracts, with a Process</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Call in a contractor to fix a hole in your roof.

We all know that the purpose of a review is to document an honest experience with a product.
