Noverse is sad to announce that we have taken down **Emergency List** and **Sights to See** from the iPhone App Store.

### What? Really? Why?

* These apps were developed two years ago, for old versions of the iPhone, and no longer represent the best we can do. We were learning  iOS at the time, did not have access to the right designers and did the best we could back then. It got us the business we did the last 2 years. But they are not good enough to keep alive.
* They were not selling. We had ~4,600 downloads of **Emergency List** and about 50 sales of **Sights to See** over *2 years*! Neither were volume sellers, nor profitable in any way.
* The app store itself it getting overcrowded.  We don't want to add to this overcrowding with our early apps. We would rather spend our time focussing on a few new products (including iOS) and have a small set of awesome apps in the store instead.
* We're not motivated to enhance or maintain them anymore, again, because there are too few customers. If we were, we'd rewrite and redesign them as we know so much better now.

### To our Existing Customers

The **Sights to See** server services will continue running, however we will no longer be adding or updating the data.

The applications will continue running on your iPhones, but make sure to back them up, because you will no longer be able to re-download them from the app store.
