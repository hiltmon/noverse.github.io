We at Noverse wish to thank all our wonderful clients and partners for such a brilliant *third* year in business. Unfortunately, most of our clients prefer to remain private, as in:

> The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.  
> The second rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.

No matter, you know who you are.

Thank you for taking a chance on a growing business to service your needs. We have taken great pleasure in working with you, meeting your needs, delivering the best products to you and handling all your support queries. We look forward to helping you out in the future.

The big news this year is that we released [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com), our first of our own publicly available commercial products. We also created and released several web applications for international clients and local partners, and really enjoyed creating several leading-edge in-house applications for our Hedge Fund clients. We look forward to helping our new Hedge Fund clients in the new year.

So join us, onwards and upwards into Noverseâ€™s 4th year, 2013.

Thank You.
