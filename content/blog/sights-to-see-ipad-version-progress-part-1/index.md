The iPad version of Sights to See is coming along nicely.  All the views have been strung together and I'm starting to work on the details and aesthetics.

Here are a few screenshots to whet your appetite.

When you start the app, you'll see a world map with all your guides on it.  I am also experimenting with a 'tag cloud" approach to help you jump to a guide quickly, but it may not make it into the final product.

The guide map page now uses the whole screen.

And the sight details look so much cleaner, now that I have the space to work with.

In the mean time, get the iPhone version.  The iPad version will be a free upgrade.
