Kudos to the app review team at Apple, they found a crasher in the update to Emergency List that I recently submitted.  They even took the time to step through and document what they did exactly to reproduce the error.

From their email:
    
    1. Launch app connected to a network
    2. Tap Emergency List
    3. Tap the Add button
    4. Tap Add from Address Book
    5. App crashes
    
    Please refer to the attached crash logs.
    
They even sent two crash logs to help find the problem.

### Reading the Crash Logs

The crash logs by themselves are very difficult to read.  Below is a segment:

All I can read from this is that lines 14 and 15 above in the stack trace is where the crash happened in MY code.  But what does 0x0000641c mean?

Fortunately, I had the dSYM file for the release that they reviewed handy.  I ran the following command against it:

    dwarfdump --lookup 0x0000641c -arch armv6 EmergencyNumbers.app.dSYM

This command would tell me at what line the app failed.  And here it is:
    
    Line table file: 'AddressBookLookupTableViewController.m' line 60, 
    column 0 with start address 0x000000000000641a
    
### Determining the cause of the Crash

Going to that file and line in the source code reveals:

```
CFStringRef cfName = ABRecordCopyCompositeName(person);
aName = [NSString stringWithString:(NSString *)cfName];
CFRelease(cfName);
```
    
So the crash is happening in the ` NSString stringWithString`.  If `cfName` is equal to nil, this line of code will crash. 

### Understanding the Error

But this error makes no sense to me.  In line 59, `cfName` is populated with the composite name from a valid address book record (person is not nil).  According to Apple's reference documentation, ABRecordCopyCompositeName returns:
    
    For group records: The value of the group name property
    	(kABGroupNameProperty).
    For person records: The concatenated value of these properties:
    	Prefix, Suffix, Organization, First name, and Last name.
    
I just assumed that all contact records in the address book would actually have a name of some kind.  _And I was wrong!_  It turns out that it is possible to create address book entries with none of the above fields filled in.  And my code should support that.

### The Fix

Easy.  If `cfName` is `nil`, use a default name called "No Name", just like the address book on Mac OS X.  I noticed that the iPhone address book works differently in that it has a cascade of which fields it shows before coming up with "No Name", but that is not necessary for my app.
    
```
// It is possible for address books to have no name entries
CFStringRef cfName = ABRecordCopyCompositeName(person);
if (cfName != nil)
{
	aName = [NSString stringWithString:(NSString *)cfName];
	CFRelease(cfName);
}
else
{
	aName = @"No Name";
}
```

### Lessons Learned

* Always save the dSYM file from each release so that you can drill on crash reports.
* Always save a snapshot of each release version in source code control so you can pull out the right code base to match the crash report.
* Watch out for assumptions when writing code.  I assumed all address book contacts would have names.  I was wrong!

Once again, thanks Apple Review People for catching this.
