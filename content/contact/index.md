Noverse LLC is currently a small indie developer. We really enjoy receiving your comments, especially well written eloquent ones, but are not very good at responding. We will most definitely read every comment received, but only respond to some. If we do not get back to you, it does not mean you are being ignored.

Its us, not you.

Please send all comments to: [comments@noverse.com](mailto:comments@noverse.com)
